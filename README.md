# Text-to-Speech and Speech Recognition with Python

This project demonstrates how to use gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) and SpeechRecognition libraries in Python to convert text to speech and speech to text.

# Features:

Convert text to spoken audio saved as an MP3 file using gTTS.

Recognize speech from microphone input using SpeechRecognition.

Simple example of combining both for a basic voice interaction.

# Installation:

Install the required Python packages:
pip install gTTS SpeechRecognition pyaudio

Note: pyaudio is required for microphone input. On some systems, you may need to install portaudio development headers before installing pyaudio.
Both gTTS and SpeechRecognition require an active internet connection.
